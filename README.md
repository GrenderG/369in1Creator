# 369 in 1 Creator
Small (ugly but functional) utility to build a multiboot rom to flash in 369 in 1 bootleg cartridges. Specifically these ones (it will also work in Zelda 7 in 1 cartridges but keep in mind they have half of the flash size, so they can't fit 256 MB like the 369 in 1 ones): <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GrenderG/369in1Creator/master/etc/images/369in1.png" width=25% height=25%>

## Installation
You need `Python 3.7+` to run it. It uses Qt6. Simply install the `requirements.txt` and run `main.py`.

## Acknowledgements
**BennVenn** is the original author of the menu being used as a base to generate the multiboot rom.
